# Projects Portfolio

This repo collects projects I’ve built while learning and improving my software skills.
I keep the focus on building, testing, and automating — mainly with Node.js, .NET, Python, and Docker.

## Featured Projects

### 🌐 HealthPulse (Node.js, Express, Jest, Docker)
A small service with health, readiness, and metrics endpoints.
Good for practicing API design, logging, and automated tests.

### 📋 KanbanLite (.NET Web API, xUnit)
A minimal Kanban API in .NET.
Built to learn clean architecture, DTOs, and containerization.

### ⚙️ SRE-Checklist-CLI (Python CLI, Pytest)
A command-line tool to run SRE checklists and routines.
Helps with automation, reliability, and test-driven development.

### 🛠️ ServiDesk-Lite (.NET solution)
A lightweight service desk skeleton with layered architecture (API/Core/Infra/Tests).
Useful for practicing separation of concerns and working with larger solutions.

## Tech I Use
- Node.js / Express with Jest
- .NET 9 with xUnit
- Python 3 with pytest
- Docker / Docker Compose
- GitHub Actions for CI/CD

## Running the Projects
Each project has its own README. Most follow this pattern:
    make install
    make test
    make run
