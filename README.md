# Projects Portfolio

This repo collects projects I've built while learning and improving my software skills.
I focus on building, testing, and automation â€” mainly with Node.js, .NET, Python, and Docker.

## Featured Projects

### HealthPulse (Node.js, Express, Jest, Docker)
Small service with health, readiness, and metrics endpoints. Good practice for API design, logging, and automated tests.

### KanbanLite (.NET Web API, xUnit)
Minimal Kanban API in .NET. Built to learn clean architecture, DTOs, and containerization.

### SRE-Checklist-CLI (Python CLI, Pytest)
CLI to run SRE checklists and routines. Focus on automation, reliability, and TDD.

### ServiDesk-Lite (.NET solution)
Lightweight service desk skeleton with layered architecture (API/Core/Infra/Tests).

## Tech I Use
- Node.js / Express with Jest
- .NET 9 with xUnit
- Python 3 with pytest
- Docker / Docker Compose
- GitHub Actions for CI/CD

## Running the Projects
Each project has its own README. Most follow:
  make install
  make test
  make run
